    <p>This is very popular dish in some of the Caribbean islands such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Dominican Republic.</p>
    <p>Although it is essentially the same dish, each island has a different touch of flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 (1 pound) New York strip steak, sliced thin</li>
        <li>3 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Â½ cup beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sofrito</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Sprinkle over steak slices on all sides to season. Transfer steak to a resealable plastic bag and add sliced onions, vinegar, and onion powder. Move steaks around to combine with the marinating ingredients. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add steak and onion mixture; cook and stir until steak is browned and onions are soft, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the skillet and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth, sofrito, and garlic to the skillet and cook over medium heat until garlic is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add steak and onions back to the skillet, cover, and simmer over low heat until onions and steak are cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
